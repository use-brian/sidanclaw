/**
 * saveChatMedia — land an archived chat attachment in the workspace file
 * layer, where every delivery surface can reach it.
 *
 * The archive owns the bytes (content-addressed, keyed by sha256) and search
 * hits carry `media_sha256`/`media_mime`, but until now nothing could get the
 * bytes back OUT: "can you send me that file" dead-ended with "the record has
 * no downloadable path". This tool closes the loop the same way
 * `imapSaveAttachment` does for email: fetch from the seam → workspace file →
 * hand the returned `fileId` to `sendFile` for delivery or `ingestFile` for
 * consent-gated semantic reading (or let the user grab it in Files).
 *
 * Owner identity comes from ToolContext, never from the input schema — the
 * store additionally resolves the digest under the owner's row-level
 * security, so a foreign digest is a 404 indistinguishable from a missing one.
 *
 * [COMP:tools/chat-archive-save-media]
