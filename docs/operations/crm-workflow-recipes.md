# Fictional CRM workflow recipes

`scripts/crm/fixtures/association-workflows.json` provides five disabled
workflow definitions with sample inputs and fake read results. Use the normal
workflow editor/API to review a copy, bind catalog IDs and select permissions.
The file never installs itself or enables sending. Sample IDs, people, addresses
and channels are fictional. `sampleVars` are test evidence, never inputs to a
live workflow: live reads populate those variables.

| Recipe | Binding and behavior |
|---|---|
| Submission notification | Subscribe to committed `crm.submission.received`; bind an approved operator-notice purpose, mailbox and operator address. One frozen notice uses the domain-event UUID as its delivery id and requires review. Add an intake-definition tag filter when only one form should notify. |
| Event registration | Manual typed `recordCrmParticipation` with a stable registration source id. Use an unconstrained event. A live ticketed/capacity event requires the Association order path and will reject this generic mutation. |
| Membership onboarding | Subscribe to `crm.entitlement.changed`, re-read current effective access for the contact/plan, then create a normal task only when the active event still has effective membership. The task carries `crm_contact_id` and entitlement attribution. No paid status is inferred from the event text. |
| Weekly deal digest | Bind a deal segment and operator channel. The optional prose step may use only CRM segment reads, follows every page and reports incomplete reads. It cannot change deals or authorize outreach. |
| Managed outreach | Manual contact, recipient, stable delivery UUID and frozen subject/body; preview sendability, then require review. The shared delivery service rechecks every recipient at dispatch, including after approval. A preview or audience snapshot is not continuing permission. |

Every recipe needs the relevant assistant CRM read/write and Tasks grants;
mailbox access is separate from CRM write authority. The normal tool registry
and workspace policy decide whether each tool is available. Review missing
permissions in the owner interface; a workflow cannot grant them to itself.
Association disable does not remove generic CRM access, and these recipes do not
enable Association. Commerce workflows must use its canonical commands.

Workflow start replay is keyed by the committed CRM domain-event identity. Keep
that identity through retries. A lost delivery response must reuse the same
frozen delivery id and inspect the receipt. Do not retry an uncertain task step
as a fresh workflow to force another task; inspect the existing workflow run and
task admission result. A genuinely separate message needs a distinct stable
id established before the first attempt. Never mutate a receipt's envelope to
reuse an id for a different recipient or message.

The local fixture checks definition/trigger shape, actual typed tool arguments,
effective-access and sendability branch behavior, source identity and privacy
attribution. Tool-registry integration and the full fake workflow/channel run
are separate acceptance checks. No model call, live mail, installed workflow or
staff acceptance is claimed by schema tests. Bind real accounts/policies and
perform the controlled staff/outage exercises only in the operator's approved
QA workspace.
